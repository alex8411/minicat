This is the main Software for MiniCat allowing :

- the control of the robot through a low cost infrared remote control

- control means moving MiniCat legs thanks to servo motors

- the servo motors positions are adjusted by the Software depending on :
   -  the current position of MiniCat evaluated automatically by the Inertial Measurement Sensor (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)   
   -  the position or moving style sent by user via the IR remote control (or Arduino IDE serial terminal) to MiniCat
