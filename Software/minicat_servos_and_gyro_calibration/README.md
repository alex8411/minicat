Adding minicat_servos_and_gyro_calibration.ino in order to :
- put all servos at their central zero position before mounting the legs of MiniCat
- meassure the offset of the gyro yaw pitch roll angles compared to the default zero angles in the Gyro board firmware (MiniCat should be put on a flat surface)
