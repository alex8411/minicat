Here the files you need to produce a complete MiniCat kit :

- the original .STL files : 
  -  those are the meshed files that you can import in any Slicer software to print them (Cura, Prusa, Creality etc..) 

- the 3D Printer (Anycubic Chiron) project file :
  -  the project file will use the .gcode machine code files that will be used directly by the printer
  -  the Anycubic Chiron has the benefit of a very wide Heatbed (400 x 400 x 450mm) that allow you to produce the full MiniCat kit overnight (around 11hours)
