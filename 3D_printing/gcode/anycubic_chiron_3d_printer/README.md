Here as an example I provide gcode for the print of all parts of MiniCat.
The gcode format is the machine code that the 3D printer uses to move the stepper motors and control the extruder.

WARNING !

This is just as an example and I do not recommend to print all parts at once as different parts have different heights 
and the more parts you have on your printing plate, the highest the risk of failure !

My recommendation is to generate gcode and print parts as batches as already grouped in the STL folder.
